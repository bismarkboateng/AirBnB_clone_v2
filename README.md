# AirBnB clone - The console <br> 
The goal of this project is to create a basic clone of AirBnB, which operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

# command interpreter or console 

Utilizing a robust storage system is the first step. We will be able to abstract between "My Object" and "How they are saved and persisted" thanks to this storage engine. This implies that you won't have to pay attention to (take care of) how your objects are saved from your console code (the command interpreter itself) or from the front-end and RestAPI you will write later.

# how to start it:

In order to start the console, you must use the following command: ./console.py


# How to use: 

 * manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
 * store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
 * Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit
 

### Example how to open:
> $ ./console.py <br>
> (hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
 
<br>
(hbnb) <br>
(hbnb) <br>
(hbnb) quit
$
