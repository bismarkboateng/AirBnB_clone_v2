# AirBnB clone - The console # <br> 
The AirBnB console this about create a minishell, this console works in interactive and non-interactive mode; this project is just a basic copy of AirBnB,

<br> 
# command interpreter or console # <br> 
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

<br> 
# how to start it: # <br> 
In order to start the console, you must use the following command: ./console.py

<br> 
# How to use: 3 # <br> 
 * manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
 * store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
 * Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit
